    <p class="prologue">This is the story of a world called Ivalice. Two years after the war in which the kingdom of Dalmasca was destroyed by the 
        invasion of the mighty military nation, the Arcadia Empire I longed for the freedom to run in the sky. The only surviving 
        princess in her royal family, Ashe, secretly led the PLA to revive her homeland and vowed that revenge on her empire was her 
        duty. Their wishes and hopes, which they met during the wartime era, connect the fate of people and change the fate of nations.</p>
